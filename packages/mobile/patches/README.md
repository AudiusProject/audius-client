### react-native-tab-view+3.1.1.patch

This patch was necessary to fix a layout issue when react-navigation's `MaterialTopTabNavigation` component is rendered inside a `ScrollView` or `FlatList`. This prevented our profile-screen from correctly rendering each tab and its content. There are numerous open issues regarding this: 
 - https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view/issues/1274
 - https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view/issues/1178
 - https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view/pull/1198
 - https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view/pull/1237

There is a fix implemented [here](https://github.com/knockaway/react-native-tab-view/tree/forked-3.0.2), however the package author hasn't merged it (or any other pr) for half a year and counting. This patch simply copies the ~7 lines of code changes required to solve the issue.
