# Audius Mobile Client

The Audius React Native mobile client

## Setup

### Extra iOS Setup

```bash
# install cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods

cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Running iOS

```bash
# Run a simulator using a prod configuration
npm run ios
# Run a simulator using a stage configuration
npm run ios:bounce
# Run a simulator using a dev configuration
npm run ios:dev

# Run the app on a device
npm run ios:device "Raymond's iPhone"
# To see available devices
xcrun xctrace list devices
```

## Running Android

```bash
# Run a simulator using a prod configuration
npm run android
# Run a simulator using a stage configuration
npm run android:bounce
# Run a simulator using a dev configuration
npm run android:dev

# Look at android devices
adb devices
# Connect device to dev server
adb -s <device name> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
# Run on device
npm run android
```

If you run into issues, try cleaning the android build folder

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

## Debugging

- To debug the app, install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) and enable debugging (Cmd + D) in the simulator.

On iOS, make sure that [Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes) is disabled before starting the app in order to debug:

```bash
npm run disable-hermes:ios && pod install
```

Once you are ready to commit changes, you can enable Hermes again to avoid erroneous Podfile commits:

```bash
npm run enable-hermes:ios && pod install
```

On Android, you can use the adb Android Studio tool or

```bash
# Show device logs
adb logcat '*:V'
```

- Sometimes the app will crash due a configuration error or something outside of the realm of JS and you won't get any helpful information from React Native. In those cases, it's time to break open XCode and run from there to pinpoint the issue.

## Helpful

- If your app is crashing after running for a second, or crashing on startup with no error message, it's probably an environment variable problem, and you should check to make sure you have them all. Debug using XCode.

- Other commands and things:

```
# opens debug menu on an Android device
adb shell input keyevent 82
```

```
# Busts the package cache for RN
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

```
# Clean build
# first manually close all running instances of metro
watchman watch-del-all
npm start -- --reset-cache
npm run ios:dev
```
