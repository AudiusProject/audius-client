# Solana Phone Build Tools & Config

This folder contains relevant info for releasing Audius to the Solana Mobile Stack / Saga.

## Instructions
### Install prerequesites

#### Node
Ensure we are using the correct node version
```
nvm install
nvm use
```
#### PNPM
Then, to install pnpm, run
```
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@`npm info pnpm --json | jq -r .version` --activate
```

#### Project Dependencies
Finally, install project dependencies
```
pnpm install
```

#### Solana cli
We need solana cli to recover a private key
```
brew install solana
```

### Recovering solana keypair
You will need our app's private key to mint new releases and submit updates. To recover, look up Solana Mobile on Lastpass. Open it and copy the seed phase. Then run
```
solana-keygen recover -o app-keypair.json
```
and paste the seed phase in. There is no associated password, so press enter again. This should output the private key to the app-keypair.json file. Note this file is .gitignored, but do make sure to not check it in.

### Preparing the version
Update the version name + code to the latest release, see:
https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/7193943409852709836/app/4973839560150647536/tracks/production?tab=releases

The version code needs to be a monotonically increasing number.

### Preparing the apk
cd ../android
./gradlew app:assembleRelease
cd ../dapp-store

### Validating the release

Before publishing the apk, validate the release:
```
npx dapp-store validate release -k app-keypair.json -b $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/33.0.0
```

### Publishing the apk
```
npx dapp-store create release -k app-keypair.json -b $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/33.0.0 -u https://audius-fe.rpcpool.com
```
> You may not have specified ANDROID_HOME, or have a different build tools version, modify accordingly.

> If successful, this should update .asset-manifest.json with the sha and url of our uploaded .apk, and config.yaml with an updated release mint address. Please commit and push both of these changes.

### Submit dApp update request
```
npx dapp-store publish update -k app-keypair.json -u https://audius-fe.rpcpool.com --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
```
