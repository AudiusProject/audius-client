# Audius Mobile Client

The Audius React Native mobile client.

This project is a React Native wrapper around the Audius web client, and requires a web client to be running.
The native project can be built & run against a local client (serving at localhost) or against a vendored staging/production build.

## Setup

Copy the environment variables and replace missing values. (You will need an FCM sender id as well as a Segment write key for those services to work properly, but any value will suffice if the data is not important to you.)

```bash
cp .env.dev.tmpl .env.dev
cp .env.stage.tmpl .env.stage
cp .env.prod.tmpl .env.prod
```

### iOS

```bash
# install cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
# install local dependencies
npm install

cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Create main.jsbundle
npm run bundle:ios
```

### Android

```bash
# install local dependencies
npm install
```

## Running against localhost

To run against localhost, specify `URL_OVERRIDE` in the `.env` file you intend to use.

```
URL_OVERRIDE=http://localhost:3001
```

> The WebView will be pointed at the url contained in `URL_OVERRIDE`

This URL should be a serving a mobile audius-client with either

`npm run start:mobile-stage` or `npm run start:mobile-prod`

## Running against a local static build

To run against a local staging or production build, build the client and copy the build into the mobile client:

```bash
# staging

# audius-client
npm run build:mobile-stage

# audius-mobile-client
npm run copy:local-staging

# production

# audius-client
npm run build:mobile-prod

# audius-mobile-client
npm run copy:local-production
```

## Running against a remote static build

To run against a remote staging or production build, pull a the latest dapp from s3:

> Make sure you have s3 creds set up and the aws cli installed.

```bash
# staging
npm run copy:remote-staging

# production
npm run copy:remote-production
```

## iOS

```bash
# Run a simulator using a prod configuration
npm run ios
# Run a simulator using a stage configuration
npm run ios:bounce
# Run a simulator using a dev configuration
npm run ios:dev

# Run the app on a device
npm run ios:device "Raymond's iPhone"
# To see available devices
xcrun xctrace list devices
```

## Android

```bash
# Run a simulator using a prod configuration
npm run android
# Run a simulator using a stage configuration
npm run android:bounce
# Run a simulator using a dev configuration
npm run android:dev

# Look at android devices
adb devices
# Connect device to dev server
adb -s <device name> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
# If connecting to localhost, set up port forwarding
adb -s <device name> reverse tcp:3001 tcp:3001
# Run on device
npm run android
```

If you run into issues, try cleaning the android build folder

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

## Debugging

- To debug the native-layer of the app, install [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) and enable debugging (Cmd + D) in the simulator.
- Safari can also be used to debug against the WebView running the dapp. This can be seen by opening Safari > Develop > Device > Localhost.

On Android, you can use the adb Android Studio tool or

```bash
# Show device logs
adb logcat '*:V'
```

- Sometimes the app will crash due a configuration error or something outside of the realm of JS and you won't get any helpful information from React Native. In those cases, it's time to break open XCode and run from there to pinpoint the issue.

## Helpful

- Sometimes the simulator app code won't update. You should disable caching in `settings/Network` of React Native Debugger.
- If you feel like debugging the actual static app contained in the build, you can:

```bash
npm install -g serve --user
serve -s web-app/Web.bundle/build -p 9000
```

- If your app is crashing after running for a second, or crashing on startup with no error message, it's probably an environment variable problem, and you should check to make sure you have them all. Debug using XCode.

- Other commands and things:

```
# opens debug menu on an Android device
adb shell input keyevent 82
```

```
# Busts the cache for RN
npm start -- --reset-cache
```
