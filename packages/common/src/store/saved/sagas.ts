// TODO: Move fetch sagas here
// We need waitForRead(), so a saga makes sense
// We want loading state for the album IDs (just based on account?)
// We also want loading state for album details
// * this will be paginated, so can we do loading state by chunk?
// Reasonably quick to write a reusable loading status slice/selector?
