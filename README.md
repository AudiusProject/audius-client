# Audius, your source code sucks butt

## What version of npm?
- Node 14x (latest version is fine)

## How to test this shit repo (In React)
- `npm run start:prod` (Tests against actual Audius servers)
- this repo is gay as hell and you can only run any of this shit if you use an Ubuntu instance for some damn reason

## How to build this shit repo
- Run `npm run build:prod`
- You get some errors, i.e. it won't be able to make build-production, etc.
- just ctrl+c the build folder contents into a new folder called build-production

## How to dist this shit repo
- Run my custom command `npm run dist:win:prod` because their command uploads it to a server that I do not have access to!
- Ignore the "wine not detected" error at the end of dist process for Windows. It isn't important!
- Uh it's also really slow for some damn reason
